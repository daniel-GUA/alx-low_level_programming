A project about C-variables, if, else, while
0-positive/or/negative.c-- This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
1-last/digit.c--This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.
2-print-alphabet.c --Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etcâ€¦) is forbidden). All your code should be in the main function.You can only use putchar twice in your code.
3-print-alphabets.c -- Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
4-print-alphabt.c -- Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
5-print-numbers.c -- Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
6-print-numberz.c -- Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
7-print-tebahpla.c -- Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
8-print-base16.c -- Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
9-print-comb.c -- Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
